## [0.4.1] - 2025-01-16

### üêõ Compare Tab Table Fixes

#### **Training Type Detection Fix**
- **Issue**: Compare Tab table TYPE column was defaulting to "Full" instead of showing correct LoRA/DoRA/Full values
- **Root Cause**: Table generation was using fallback logic instead of reading actual training type from session cards
- **Solution**: Modified `detectTrainingType()` to extract training type directly from session card badges (source of truth)
- **Result**: Table now correctly displays LoRA/DoRA/Full types matching the session cards

#### **Table Structure Cleanup**
- **Removed**: Iterations column from Compare Tab table as it was not informative
- **Improved**: Table is now more focused and easier to read
- **Maintained**: All essential columns (Training Session, Type, Method, Seq Len, Best Checkpoint, Best Loss, etc.)

#### **Technical Implementation**
- **Clean Solution**: Uses session cards as single source of truth for training type detection
- **Multi-layered Fallback**: Session card badges ‚Üí batch API data ‚Üí config data ‚Üí intelligent default
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Verified**: Comprehensive Playwright testing confirms fixes work correctly

### üîß Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `forgellm/web/templates/index.html` - Removed iterations column from table header
  - `forgellm/web/static/js/components/compare.js` - Enhanced training type detection and table generation
- **Approach**: Simple, maintainable solution that reuses existing UI data
- **Testing**: Automated verification ensures table shows correct types and column structure

## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-10

### üêõ Critical Memory Bug Fix

#### **Training Memory Overflow Resolution**
- **Issue**: Training sessions would fail with GPU memory errors (`[METAL] Command buffer execution failed: Insufficient Memory`) after the first iteration, despite working perfectly with direct MLX-LM command line calls
- **Root Cause**: Compare Tab was making 50+ simultaneous API requests when switching tabs during training, creating memory spikes that interfered with MLX training
- **Timeline**: Issue appeared between July 6-10, 2025 when Compare Tab functionality was introduced

#### **Technical Details**
- **Problem Pattern**: Training would complete first iteration successfully, then fail during second iteration with OOM error
- **Memory Impact**: 50+ sessions √ó 2 API calls each = 100+ concurrent requests consuming 750MB-3.5GB during critical training moments
- **Trigger Mechanism**: Compare Tab session restoration from localStorage during training would call `handleSessionChange()` for each previously selected session

#### **Fix Implementation**
- **Multi-Layer Protection**: Added training detection at 4 different levels to prevent any Compare Tab API calls during active training
  1. **SessionDataManager**: Blocks individual session data loading with training status check
  2. **Tab Activation**: Shows warning message without making API calls when training detected
  3. **Session Restoration**: Skips loading sessions that were previously selected
  4. **Badge Population**: Checks training status before fetching session data for UI updates

- **Duplicate Training Prevention**: Added `isTraining` flag to prevent race conditions that could launch multiple training processes simultaneously

- **Rate Limiting**: Added 10 requests/5 seconds limit as backup protection against API request floods

#### **Results**
- Training now works reliably without memory conflicts
- Compare Tab gracefully disabled during training with clear user messaging
- No more duplicate training process launches
- Eliminated 100+ concurrent API request spikes during training

### üîß Technical Infrastructure
- **Error Handling**: Added error messages when session loading blocked during training
- **User Experience**: Clear warning messages explain why Compare Tab features are temporarily unavailable
- **Backward Compatibility**: All changes maintain existing functionality when training is not active
