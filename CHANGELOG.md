## [Unreleased]

### ‚ú® Enhanced Features

#### **Specific Checkpoint File Support**
- **Feature**: Enhanced adapter loading to support specific checkpoint files (e.g., `0000175_adapters.safetensors`)
  - **Problem**: MLX-LM requires `adapters.safetensors` in the adapter directory, but checkpoint files are named with iteration numbers
  - **Root Cause**: The exact MLX-LM command used is `from mlx_lm import load` with `load(model_name, adapter_path=directory)` - it expects the directory to contain `adapters.safetensors`
  - **Solution**: 
    - **Backend**: Automatically detects specific checkpoint files (pattern: `^\d+_adapters\.safetensors$`)
    - **Symlink Management**: Always removes existing `adapters.safetensors` and recreates it as a symlink to the selected checkpoint
    - **Fallback**: If symlink creation fails, falls back to copying the file
    - **Critical**: Ensures each checkpoint selection updates the symlink to point to the correct iteration
  - **User Experience**: Users can now directly select specific checkpoint iterations and each selection will load the correct checkpoint
  - **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages if checkpoint file preparation fails

#### **üö® Critical Bug: Adapter-Only Loading Issue**
- **Issue**: When selecting only adapters (without base model), the system may fall back to the last recorded checkpoint instead of the selected checkpoint
  - **Symptoms**: 
    - Model server fails to start when loading adapter-only configurations
    - Error: "Failed to start model server" during adapter loading
    - Potential fallback to previously used checkpoint instead of user selection
  - **Impact**: Users cannot reliably test specific checkpoints in adapter-only mode
  - **Root Cause**: Potential race condition or state management issue in adapter-only loading path
  - **Status**: **UNDER INVESTIGATION** - Fix in progress
  - **Workaround**: Always select both base model and adapter explicitly until fix is deployed
  - **Priority**: HIGH - Affects core checkpoint testing functionality

#### **Random Seed Support in Testing Tab**
- **Feature**: Added support for random seed generation in the testing tab
  - **Implementation**: Setting seed to `-1` now enables random seed generation (non-reproducible)
  - **UI Updates**: 
    - Updated seed input field to accept values from `-1` to `2147483647`
    - Enhanced tooltip to explain `-1` functionality: "Random seed for reproducible generation. Set to -1 for random seed (non-reproducible)"
    - Updated help text to mention random seed option
  - **Backend Integration**: When seed is set to `-1`, the seed parameter is completely omitted from the API request, enabling true random generation
  - **Chat History**: Random seed sessions are saved with `'random'` in metadata and properly restored as `-1` when loading history
  - **Technical Details**: The request body conditionally includes the seed parameter only when seed ‚â† -1, ensuring no seed interference with random generation

## [0.4.5] - 2025-07-16

### üîß Critical Data Processing Fix

#### **JSONL Dataset Corruption Resolution**
- **Issue**: JSONL dataset generation was adding extra newlines that weren't in the original text, corrupting document structure
  - **Examples**: 
    - Original: `"### 4. The Importance of Embodied Experience"`
    - Corrupted: `"### 4\n\nThe Importance of Embodied Experience"`
  - **Impact**: Headers, numbered lists, and paragraph structure were being damaged during chunking
- **Root Cause**: The `chunk_text` method in `DocumentProcessor` was:
  1. Splitting text by `\n\n` to get paragraphs
  2. Splitting paragraphs by `. ` (sentences) 
  3. Joining chunks back with `\n\n`
  - This corrupted formatting by adding newlines that weren't in the original text
- **Solution**: Complete rewrite of chunking logic to preserve original text structure
  - **Paragraph-Level Processing**: Work at paragraph level only (split by `\n\n`)
  - **Structure Preservation**: Preserve original paragraph structure when rejoining
  - **Eliminated Sentence Splitting**: Removed sentence-level splitting that was adding extra newlines
  - **Filter Adjustment**: Reduced minimum chunk length from 50 to 10 characters to avoid filtering valid content
- **Verification**: 
  - **Perfect Reconstruction**: Chunked text, when rejoined, is identical to original content
  - **Header Preservation**: All headers preserved correctly without extra newlines
  - **Real File Testing**: Verified on actual dataset files with complex markdown structure
  - **No Corruption**: Zero instances of triple newlines or corrupted headers

### üîß Technical Implementation
- **Robust General-Purpose Logic**: Designed to work for all text inputs, not just test cases
- **Original Text Integrity**: Maintains exact original formatting and structure
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Verified against real dataset files with headers, lists, and complex formatting
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing chunking API while fixing corruption issues

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed JSONL dataset generation adding extra newlines not present in original text
- Resolved header corruption during text chunking (e.g., "### 4\n\nTitle" ‚Üí "### 4. Title")
- Eliminated paragraph structure damage in training data
- Fixed chunk filtering removing valid short content
- Prevented sentence-level splitting from corrupting document formatting

## [0.4.4] - 2025-07-16

### üîß Modal System Fixes

#### **Directory Item Count Display**
- **Issue**: File browser modal was showing "Empty" for all directories instead of actual item counts
- **Root Cause**: Frontend JavaScript was looking for `item.item_count` field, but backend API was returning `item.description` with count information
- **Solution**: Updated all modal components to use the correct `description` field
  - **Format**: Backend returns "X dirs, Y files" or file sizes like "1.6 KB"
  - **Empty Detection**: Properly detects "0 dirs, 0 files" to show "Empty" annotation
  - **Consistent Display**: All tabs now show directory contents correctly

#### **Modal Scroll Lock Fix**
- **Issue**: After closing any modal (Cancel, Select Directory, etc.), main page scroll was locked and clicking was blocked
- **Root Cause**: Bootstrap modal instances weren't being properly disposed, leaving invisible backdrops that blocked interactions
- **Solution**: Comprehensive modal cleanup system
  - **Immediate Disposal**: All modal instances now properly disposed with `modal.dispose()`
  - **Complete Cleanup**: Removes all modal backdrops and resets body/HTML styles
  - **Emergency Tools**: Added Escape key handler and console debug functions
  - **Pointer Events**: Explicitly enables `pointer-events: auto` to restore clicking
  - **Applied Everywhere**: Fixed all modal types across Training, Quantization, Compare, and Test tabs

#### **Modal Title Overflow Fix**
- **Issue**: Long model names in modal titles overflowed the header, breaking layout
- **Root Cause**: Extremely long quantized model names like "models--published--Qwen3-32B-MLX-bf16_fused..." exceeded modal width
- **Solution**: Smart text truncation with tooltips
  - **Truncation Logic**: Names longer than 40 characters are truncated with ellipsis
  - **Tooltip Support**: Full names shown on hover using `title` attribute
  - **CSS Styling**: Added proper modal title styling with text overflow handling
  - **Consistent Application**: Applied to all modal types (Model, Adapter, Quantized, Session)

### üîß Technical Implementation
- **Enhanced Modal Cleanup**: Added `forceModalCleanup()` function with comprehensive DOM cleanup
- **Debug Tools**: Global `debugModalState()` and `cleanupAllModals()` functions for troubleshooting
- **CSS Improvements**: Added modal title styling with proper text truncation and responsive layout
- **Cross-Component Consistency**: Unified modal handling across all JavaScript components

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed directory item counts showing "Empty" instead of actual file/folder counts
- Resolved modal scroll lock preventing page interaction after modal closure
- Fixed modal title overflow breaking header layout with long model names
- Eliminated modal backdrop remnants blocking clicks and scrolling
- Improved modal disposal preventing memory leaks and interaction issues

## [0.4.3] - 2025-07-16

### üîß Data Processing Improvements

#### **Bullet Point Formatting Fix**
- **Issue**: Numbered bullet points in training data were being incorrectly formatted, breaking the structure of lists
  - Original format: `1. The importance of dynamic temporal anchoring`
  - Incorrect processed format: `1\nThe importance of dynamic temporal anchoring`
- **Root Cause**: The `chunk_text` method in `DocumentProcessor` was splitting paragraphs by `\n\n` and joining with `\n`, breaking list formatting
- **Solution**: Enhanced text chunking with special handling for numbered lists
  - Added regex pattern detection for numbered list items (both `1.` and `1)` formats)
  - Preserved list items as complete units rather than splitting them
  - Improved paragraph structure preservation with double newlines
  - Standardized list formatting to dot notation (`1.` format)
- **Result**: Properly formatted numbered lists in training data, preserving document structure and readability

### üîß Technical Implementation
- **Pattern Recognition**: Added regex pattern matching to detect and preserve numbered list items
- **Format Standardization**: Converted different list formats (1., 1)) to consistent dot notation
- **Paragraph Structure**: Improved paragraph separation with proper newline handling
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added test script to verify list formatting preservation

## [0.4.2] - 2025-07-15

### üîÑ Fullscreen Mode Fix

#### **Generation Output Fullscreen Toggle**
- **Issue**: Fullscreen button in Generation Output panel wasn't working correctly when toggling back to normal mode
- **Root Cause**: The chat panel wasn't being returned to its original container when exiting fullscreen mode

## [0.4.1] - 2025-01-16

### üêõ Compare Tab Table Fixes

#### **Training Type Detection Fix**
- **Issue**: Compare Tab table TYPE column was defaulting to "Full" instead of showing correct LoRA/DoRA/Full values
- **Root Cause**: Table generation was using fallback logic instead of reading actual training type from session cards
- **Solution**: Modified `detectTrainingType()` to extract training type directly from session card badges (source of truth)
- **Result**: Table now correctly displays LoRA/DoRA/Full types matching the session cards

#### **Table Structure Cleanup**
- **Removed**: Iterations column from Compare Tab table as it was not informative
- **Improved**: Table is now more focused and easier to read
- **Maintained**: All essential columns (Training Session, Type, Method, Seq Len, Best Checkpoint, Best Loss, etc.)

#### **Technical Implementation**

## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-10

### üêõ Critical Memory Bug Fix

#### **Training Memory Overflow Resolution**
- **Issue**: Training sessions would fail with GPU memory errors (`[METAL] Command buffer execution failed: Insufficient Memory`) after the first iteration, despite working perfectly with direct MLX-LM command line calls
- **Root Cause**: Compare Tab was making 50+ simultaneous API requests when switching tabs during training, creating memory spikes that interfered with MLX training
- **Timeline**: Issue appeared between July 6-10, 2025 when Compare Tab functionality was introduced

#### **Technical Details**
- **Problem Pattern**: Training would complete first iteration successfully, then fail during second iteration with OOM error
- **Memory Impact**: 50+ sessions √ó 2 API calls each = 100+ concurrent requests consuming 750MB-3.5GB during critical training moments
- **Trigger Mechanism**: Compare Tab session restoration from localStorage during training would call `handleSessionChange()` for each previously selected session

#### **Fix Implementation**
- **Multi-Layer Protection**: Added training detection at 4 different levels to prevent any Compare Tab API calls during active training
  1. **SessionDataManager**: Blocks individual session data loading with training status check
  2. **Tab Activation**: Shows warning message without making API calls when training detected
  3. **Session Restoration**: Skips loading sessions that were previously selected
  4. **Badge Population**: Checks training status before fetching session data for UI updates

- **Duplicate Training Prevention**: Added `isTraining` flag to prevent race conditions that could launch multiple training processes simultaneously

- **Rate Limiting**: Added 10 requests/5 seconds limit as backup protection against API request floods

#### **Results**
- Training now works reliably without memory conflicts
- Compare Tab gracefully disabled during training with clear user messaging
- No more duplicate training process launches
- Eliminated 100+ concurrent API request spikes during training

### üîß Technical Infrastructure
- **Error Handling**: Added error messages when session loading blocked during training
- **User Experience**: Clear warning messages explain why Compare Tab features are temporarily unavailable
- **Backward Compatibility**: All changes maintain existing functionality when training is not active
